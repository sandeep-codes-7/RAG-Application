## Ollama setup:
- visit Official website of Ollama and download Ollama onto your local system.
- Once, it is installed, verify the installation in the terminal:
```commandline
ollama --version
```
- this should return the version of ollama that you installed.
- Open Ollama.exe, Go to settings, enable `expose to network` button.
## Model selection:
- This is totally depends on your system configuration.
- As per my system config, I've installed llama3.2:3b to use as a chat model.
```commandline
ollama run llama3.2:3b

```
- If you have any other preferences, you can use them.
## Embedding model:
- I've used nomic-embed-text:v1.5 as an embedding model.
```commandline
ollama run nomic-embed-text:v1.5
```
- You can choose your own embedding model
## Activate Ollama server:
- Go to your terminal, and type this command:
```commandline
ollama serve
```
- this will start a server at localhost:11434
- if you visit this address, you can see the message that says `ollama is running`

# running the chatbot

```
- And, that's it.

- finally, your bot is ready to chat.
